      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Finding a text selection is a basic operation of a Web browser, but the functionality is not exposed to Web developers. The FindText API provides a way for developers to find text selections, with several options to refine more targeted and flexible searches, including fuzzy matching, in a way that works well with a variety of human languages.  
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many different use cases for a custom mechanism for finding and navigating to a particular range of text in a Web document, such as [[!HTML5]] or [[!SVG]]. A developer may wish to design a webapp in which only the text in the active editing subtree, and not the controls or other application text, is returned as a result of a search, overriding the native find-text functionality. A user may wish to highlight a particular passage, and link to it, even if that selection doesn't have a <code>id</code> attribute to serve as a fragment identifier. A designer may wish to find and style a range of text without changing the markup. A developer may wish to provide a particular text-matching algorithm for searching their specific type of content, to return more meaningful results (such as fuzzy matching or term substitution). A CMS developer may wish to allow advanced review and commenting on text selections for a collaborative document. All of these use cases share the a fundamental requirement for a API to find text.  
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many challenges to finding text in a modern Web document. 

        The content may have changed; the change could be a document restructuring, the addition of content before the target selection, or even a change to the target string itself. In dynamic documents, such as real-time collaborative editing webapps, the content may change during the same session as the selection; in linking or annotation scenarios, the state is lost between sessions, so other search and anchoring strategies must be used.

        Highly repetitive content, such as poetry or lyrics, may duplicate the same passage several times, making it difficult to indicate a specific instance of that passage.

        Large documents may have many possible matches, such that search-ahead mechanism may be computationally expensive. 

        In dynamic lazy-loaded (or “infinite-scroll”) content, the text being searched for may not have been loaded into the DOM yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also quirks in some native browser find-text mechanisms that could be improved through this API. For example, most current browsers do not let the user search for text across element boundaries (such as a string broken across different paragraphs or list items), which may be unintuitive and inconvenient to the end-user. Not all browsers allow the user to specify case-sensitive or whole-word search parameters, and not all browsers indicate the number of returned results. Browsers do not typically match language patterns that may be found in non-Latin character sets, including collapsed Unicode character sequences, optional diacritical marks, or similar features, such as matching <code>o</code> to <code>ó</code>, <code>ö</code>, <code>ø</code>, and <code>oe</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, a selection of a document may contain more than text, or no text at all. Such selections include a picture and its caption, the picture alone, a specific area of a picture, a point on a rendered map, or a range of time within timed media such as audio or video. Some of these examples can be fully expressed as a DOM range; others need supplementary characteristics, which may be application-specific, in order to be addressable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The FindText API is intended to be flexible and performant. To ensure interoperability, this specification describes a default find-text algorithm, but this can be overridden by the developer. For flexibility in searches, this specification defines several parameterized selector methods, which can be applied in different ordered sequences to best match particular kinds of content, via method chaining, which will allow the developer to provide refined matching algorithms to customize the results.

        For performance reasons, the FindText API can be evoked iteratively, to find the next match in the document, rather than attempting to search the entire document for all matches.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result of a FindText search is an object that contains the found range, and any additional addressing characteristics. By running a search multiple times and comparing the results against the search criteria, a script can determine the best match for that set of search criteria. A script can also add or subtract selectors based on the results to refine a search.
      </p>


      <p class="note">
        This specification defines the behavior for documents using a Unicode character encoding, such as UTF-8. Behavior for documents using legacy character encoding, such as <code>windows-1252</code>, may be anomalous.
      </p>
      
      <p class="issue">
        Should the return object also contain the CSS and/or XPath selector that is the closest match for the selection? Can you get that easily from another Web Platform feature?
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        This specification defines what is returned, but not the specific algorithms used to find that result, or the speed or optimizations taken. Such optimizations are implementation-specific.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        For character counts in ranges, what exactly would be counted as a character? Unicode code points? Graphemes?
      </p>

      <p class="issue">
        Address the issue of multiple concurrent FindText objects executing, especially when they are from different code bases (e.g. a custom find-in-page dialog running at the same time as an annotation client library). Presumably, the implementation could optimize by having them use the same <a>search content</a>?
      </p>

      <p class="issue">
        What's the expectation for updating the <a>search content</a> to reflect the state of the dynamic DOM, while a FindText object is executing?
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        This specification shares some conceptual similarities to the Selection API. Both deal with collections of ranges; while the Selection API deals with user actions in a live DOM, the FindText API deals with programmatic selection of ranges based on text criteria. The main interrelation between them is that one user might make a selection in a document, which can be serialized as text in such a way that another user could recreate that selection on their own instance of the document (e.g. you can store and share selections across devices). The use cases are otherwise very different.

        The EditDistance Interface
      </h2>
      <p>The EditDistance API defines a method to calculate the minimum <a>edit distance</a> between any two strings. This method uses the Levenshtein Distance algorithm, with the following operations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adding one character to the target string.</li>
        <li>Deleting one character from the target string.</li>
        <li>Replacing one character of the target string with another character.</li>

      <p class="issue">
        What are the minimum criteria for performing a search? You might usefully look for what's between the prefix and suffix, or what is at a certain range. Should we allow that, or require that the <code>text</code> attribute not be the empty string?

      <p class="issue">
        Should we include an option to ignore punctuation? Apparently use of punctuation is widely variable and often changed, so this improves search efficiency.

      <h3>Performing a search operation</h3>
      <p>A conforming <a>user agent</a> MUST perform a search operation in a manner that produces results consistent with this following algorithm. A conforming <a>user agent</a> MAY optimize the search algorithm in any way that produces these consistent results.</p>

      <div class='note'>
        <h4>Search Algorithm summary</h4>
        <p>
          The <code>FindText</code> <code>search()</code> method initiates an incremental text search of that portion 
          of the document set as the <code>scope</code> parameter of the <code>FindText</code> object, starting at its <code>startRange</code> parameter. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The search process starts by finding the scope of the search; given the <code>scope</code> range, it first finds the parent start and end elements, and all elements between them; these element comprise the <a>search tree</a>. It then extracts the text content of all these elements, and truncates everything outside the start and end character positions, using the algorithm defined for the <code>textContent</code> attribute in [[!DOM4]]; this is referred to as the <a>search content</a>.  
        </p>
        <p>
          In the <a>search content</a>, <code>target text</code>, and <code>prefix and suffix text</code>, all multiple consecutive whitespace characters, including newline characters, are collapsed into single space characters. If the <code>caseFolding</code> attribute is set to true, all characters are converted into their lowercase equivalents (if any). If the <code>unicodeNormalization</code> attribute is set to true, all characters are converted into their decomposed equivalents (if any), per the [[!charmod-norm]] spec. <i>If the <code>ignorePunctuation</code> attribute is set to true, all punctuation characters are removed.</i> (How should <code>wholeWord</code> be modeled?)
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the <a>search content</a>, <code>target text</code>, and  <code>prefix and suffix text</code> are normalized according to the required parameters, the search operation is begun. The starting point of the search is the character position of the <code>startRange</code> attribute; if this character position lies outside the scoped range, then the starting point of the search is the 0 position of the <a>search content</a> string.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>target text</code> is then incrementally compared with the <a>search content</a>, within the tolerance of the specified <a href="#edit_distance">edit distance</a>. Each such operation is performed at the current <a>search cursor</a>x character, starting with the first character and proceeding to each subsequent character. If there is a match, the prefix and suffix strings are also tested against the surrounding text and within their respective specified <a href="#edit_distance">edit distance</a> tolerances. If this also matches, then the process stops and the return results are prepared. If no appropriate match is found, the cursor character is incremented by a single character until a match is found, or until the end of the <a>search content</a> is reached if the <code>wrap</code> attribute is set to false. If the <code>wrap</code> attribute is set to true, and the start position was not the 0 position of the <a>search content</a> string, the search only concludes when the start position has been reached.
        </p>
        <p>
          The return results are prepared by first reconciling the matched string with its equivalent DOM range in the document. This range object is created, and bundled in an object with the original search parameters. This return object is in the form of a Promise, so the results can be analyzed and subsequent search operations can be performed by incrementing the start range position based on the matched range (if any). By performing this search multiple times, an application can incrementally find all matching ranges in the document.
        </p>

      <h4>Search Algorithm</h4>
      <p>The steps to <dfn>perform a search operation</dfn> on a <a>document</a> using <a>FindText</a> are as follows:</p>

      <p class="issue">
        This algorithm is still a rough draft, and may change based on concrete feedback.

      <ol id="search_algorithm">
        <li>If the <a>user agent</a> does not support searching the <a>document</a> using <a>FindText</a>,

          <code>DOMException</code> whose name is
          <code>NotSupportedError</code> and halt these steps.
        </li>
        <li>The following sub-steps MAY be run asynchronously for performance reasons, for example, if the <a>user agent</a> has <dfn>browsing contexts</dfn> living in different processes:

<!-- 

The target text is then incrementally compared with the search content, within the tolerance of the specified edit distance. Each such operation is performed at the current cursor character, starting with the first character and proceeding to each subsequent character. If there is a match, the prefix and suffix strings are also tested against the surrounding text and within their respective specified edit distance tolerances. If this also matches, then the process stops and the return results are prepared. If no appropriate match is found, the cursor character is incremented by a single character until a match is found, or until the end of the search content is reached if the wrap attribute is set to false. If the wrap attribute is set to true, and the start position was not the 0 position of the search content string, the search only concludes when the start position has been reached.

The return results are prepared by first reconciling the matched string with its equivalent DOM range in the document. This range object is created, and bundled in an object with the original search parameters. This return object is in the form of a Promise, so the results can be analyzed and subsquent search operations can be performed by incrementing the start range position based on the matched range (if any). By performing this search multiple times, an application can incrementally find all matching ranges in the document.

      <h3>Calculating edit distance</h3>
      <p>A conforming <a>user agent</a> MUST calculate the edit distance of 2 strings in a manner that produces results consistent with this following algorithm. A conforming <a>user agent</a> MAY optimize the search algorithm in any way that produces these consistent results.</p>

      <div class='note'>
        <h4>Calculating Edit Distance Algorithm summary</h4>
        <p>The edit distance is calculated by first finding and comparing the matching sequence of codepoints in both strings, regardless of intervening extra characters. If the count of the mutual sequence of codepoint matches is within the user-defined tolerance limit (of <code>textDistance</code>, <code>prefixDistance</code>, and <code>suffixDistance</code>, respectively), then the string is considered a match using the change, insertion, or deletion operations.</p>

        <p>For example, the words <i>complete</i> and <i>computer</i> have the following mutual sequence of letters: <i>c</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>t</i>, and <i>e</i>. This pair has an edit distance of 3, because you must perform 3 operations: delete the <i>l</i>, change the <i>e</i> to an <i>u</i>, and add an <i>r</i>. So, a search for <i>complete</i> with an edit distance of 3 would also match <i>computer</i> (as well as more obvious matches like <i>completes</i>, <i>completed</i>, and <i>compete</i>).</p>

        <p>Note that in practice, all three of these operations can be combined, and are typically performed simultaneously.</p>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p class="warning">
        This examples section is very much in flux, and the syntx may be wrong. The general ideas should be similar, but the syntax may be quite different. There may even be changes to the API based on feedback on the examples.
      </p>

      <p>
        Poetry, lyrics, and some prose often include significant repetition. A simple find-text operation would return only the first instance of a repetition, while the selection in question might be for the second or third instance.

      <section id="example-1" class="informative">
        <h3>Example 1</h3>
        <p>
          In the following poem, there are four instances of the phrase “<i>Rage, rage</i>”; the desired selection is the third instance. Assuming an HTML page consisting only of the poem, there are several ways to use the FindText API to achieve this, a few of which are demonstrated below. Any or all of these techniques can be applied to ensure robust anchoring.

            I don't think the algorithm currently accounts for the "character count" behavior, but you should have a way to make a match based only on character count and offsets in the searchContent, without a target string, for increased robustness (using multiple fallback selection criteria) and flexibility. Ranges only do this in the document, and we might want finer control for searchContent. But I'm not sure if this is the right way to do it. When scope was a range, that might have been another way.

            Actually, this might not work, because the range is on the document, while it's being applied to the normalized searchContent. Maybe there should be an intervening step.
